# Click Through Rate Analysis

This repository contains notebooks for analysis of data from [Kaggle Click-Through-Rate prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data).

In [Data-prep.ipynb](https://github.com/tatyana-perlova/Click-Through-Rate-Analysis/blob/master/notebooks/Data-prep.ipynb) data is aggregated (hourly CTR is calculated) and prepared for analysis.
